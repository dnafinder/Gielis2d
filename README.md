Use Gielis'es superformula in 2d plot<br/>
The superformula is a generalization of the superellipse and was first
proposed by Johan Gielis.

Gielis suggested that the formula can be used to describe many complex
shapes and curves that are found in nature. Others point out that the
same can be said about many formulas with a sufficient number of
parameters.
